						<p>In the vibrant and bustling world of Sensormatic (aka Crativesystems) Porto's Office, a place where the air is colder than the artic pole during winter and hotter than hell during summer, along with the hum of computers struggling between compiling the code and the zScaler's processes all mixed with the scent of freshly brewed coffee, a peculiar yet profoundly effective debugging technique has taken root among the community of developers, both novice and seasoned alike: "Rubber Duck Debugging". </p>

							<h2>In the beginning</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
                            At the center of our story is Joãozinho, a junior developer whose journey through the maze of code and complex algorithms to get the RFID tags where they belong, has been marked by moments of brilliance as well as bouts of baffling bugs. Joãozinho, like many before them, often found himself at a crossroads, teetering between the desire to seek immediate help for every minor issue and the determination to develop self-reliance and problem-solving skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was during one of these moments of uncertainty that Joãozinho remembered some elder developer talking about "The Legend of Rubber Duck Debugging", where ancient developers during those dark days when Stackoverflow wasn't even an idea, were found theirselves talking with a little rubber duck to solve out their development problems. Those ancient develpers where able to figuring it out without wasting someone else's time, armed only with a newfound sense of curiosity and a modest yellow rubber duck, a gift from a more experienced colleague.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Joãozinho embarked on a journey of discovery and self-improvement.
                        </p>

                            <h2>The Journey</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            The ritual was simple yet oddly cathartic. Joãozinho would sit at his desk, the rubber duck perched attentively on the monitor, and he begin to explain his code in the simplest terms possible. Each variable, function, and loop was laid bare, subjected to the scrutiny of Joãozinho's narration and the duck's silent gaze.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To Joãozinho's astonishment, the process proved remarkably effective. More often than not, the act of verbalising his thought process illuminated oversights and errors that had previously lurked unseen amidst the lines of code. The rubber duck, a silent confidant, became an indispensable tool in Joãozinho's debugging arsenal, a symbol of the power of clear thinking and articulation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The technique, however, was not without its moments of humor and humility. Colleagues passing by Joãozinho's desk would often pause, with a mixture of amusement and intrigue on their faces as they witnessed the earnest conversation between developer and duck. Yet, these moments of levity only served to strengthen the sense of community within the office, as others were inspired to adopt rubber duck debugging themselves, leading to a collection of colourful ducks adorning desks throughout the workspace.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rubber Duck Debugging became more than just a debugging technique; it evolved into a philosophy, a testament to the value of patience, persistence, and the willingness to embrace unconventional methods in the pursuit of understanding. Joãozinho, once a novice developer, grew in confidence and competence, with his trusty rubber duck by his side through every challenge and victory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And so, in the annals of Sensormatic (aka Crativesystems), the tale of rubber duck debugging stands as a reminder that sometimes, the simplest solutions are the most effective, and that the journey to becoming a better developer is one filled with continuous learning, self-reflection, and, occasionally, a little bit of patience.

                            Nowadays, the technology evolved and we have access to tons of information in just a few clicks, the power of AI promising to help us (and probably to substitute us in a near future) to achieve solutions that we didn't imagine before.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "The Legend of Rubber Duck Debugging" is risking to be forgotten, making new developers to lose one ancient but legendary tool to find their way through the guts of the code and defeat those bugs that seems to evolve into features from time to time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Rubber duck debugging is a simple yet effective problem-solving technique that should't be forgotten.

						    <h2>Rubber Duck Debugging: The Technique</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            Rubber duck debugging is a simple yet effective problem-solving technique. You explain your code, line by line, to a rubber duck (or any inanimate object but the duck seems to be the more effective one). The act of verbalising your thought process often reveals logical errors, misunderstandings, and potential solutions.
